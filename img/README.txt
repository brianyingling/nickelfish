We have designed a homepage for one of our internal NF teams.  We are looking to have each of the 4 large project images cycle through after about 5 seconds.  There is a dark grey bar at the top of the design, just under the primary navigation bar.  The idea for the animation is the following:

The page loads up with the first image
After 5 seconds, the thin horizontal dark grey at the top of the page expands downwards vertically and covers the whole project image.  
Once the grey curtain cover is all the way down, the new project image loads in behind the cover.
Once loaded, the grey bar shrinks back up to it's original size, revealing the new project image.
Rinse and repeat.
The animation should be snappy and sharp, but have some easing and/or bounce.  It needs to have a personality, not just be programatic movement.

Build out the HTML/CSS for the page and all the JS for the animation.  

Further, we've included JSON which contains what would be a sample response from a CMS we would use to manage the site and the homepage slideshow. The project name text in the middle of the page should also be loaded dynamically.  Read the JSON file and build your slideshow and text as if it were being generated out of a CMS. Feel free to edit the JSON file as needed.

You have a maximum of 8 hours to see how much of this you can get completed.  If you don't get it finished (which i don't think anyone has), no worries, just show us what you have.  After you're finished or 8 hours has elapsed, just post it up to your site so we can review it along with a zip of all the source.
